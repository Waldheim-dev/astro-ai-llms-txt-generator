# Contributing to @waldheimdev/astro-ai-llms-txt-generator

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our Astro integration! Here are some guidelines to help you get started.

## 🛠️ Development Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Waldheim-dev/astro-ai-llms-txt-generator.git
    cd astro-ai-llms-txt-generator
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run tests:**
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

4.  **Lint and Format:**
    ```bash
    npm run lint
    npm run format
    ```

## 🚀 Workflow

1.  **Create a branch:** Use a descriptive name like `feat/new-provider` or `fix/logic-error`.
2.  **Commit your changes:** We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (e.g., `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `chore: ...`).
3.  **Push and Open a PR:** Push your branch to GitHub and open a Pull Request against the `main` branch.

## 🧪 Testing

Every feature or bug fix should include corresponding tests in the `test/` directory. We use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for testing.

## 📦 Releases

Releases are handled automatically via `semantic-release` on the `main` branch. Ensure your commit messages follow the conventional commit format to trigger the correct version bump.
